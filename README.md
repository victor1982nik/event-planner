Event Planner

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Live page
The live page for this project is available via the following link: https://victor1982.github.io/event-planner/

The website currently allows:
browsing through available events
opening an event page to see more details about the selected event
creating new events
editing the existing events
deleting events
filtering the events by categories
filtering the events by title via entering the keywords into the search form in the top bar
The website has adaptive design, developed for all types of devices (mobile phones, tablets and desktops).

The website has potential for some other features, like more sorting optons, pagination of the list of events, support of other languages, authorization and personal events. These (and some others) are included in a roadmap for further development of this project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
